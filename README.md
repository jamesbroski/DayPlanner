# DayPlanner

This assignment was to build a simple day planner for our user to utilize structuring different tasks during business hours.

The function for this Day Planner is to show the date of that day, and to be able to enter text into each hour block.
There is a save button on the end of the row to save the text entered to their local storage so it saves when the website is refreshed.

Below is a screenshot of what the user should see when suing this application:

Overall this assignment was very fun. Building a useful day planner is a great tool to have in our toolbox for future use!
